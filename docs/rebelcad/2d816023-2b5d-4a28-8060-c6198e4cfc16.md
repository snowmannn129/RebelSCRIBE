# LengthConstraint

**API Version:** 1.0.0

**Component:** RebelCAD

Represents a length constraint on geometric entities

The LengthConstraint ensures that a geometric entity maintains a specific length.
For lines, this is the direct distance between endpoints. For circles/arcs, this
would be the diameter/arc length (to be implemented).
