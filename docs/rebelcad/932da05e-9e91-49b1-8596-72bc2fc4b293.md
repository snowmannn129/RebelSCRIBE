# PerpendicularConstraint

**API Version:** 1.0.0

**Component:** RebelCAD

Represents a perpendicular constraint between two line segments

The PerpendicularConstraint ensures that two line segments remain perpendicular 
(90 degrees) to each other. A line segment is defined by two points (x1,y1) and 
(x2,y2). The constraint uses vector mathematics to determine perpendicularity 
and enforce the constraint.
