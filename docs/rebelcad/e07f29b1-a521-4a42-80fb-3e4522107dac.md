# LengthConstraint

**API Version:** 1.0.0

**Component:** RebelCAD

Represents a length constraint on geometric entities

The LengthConstraint ensures that a geometric entity maintains a specific length.
For lines, this is the direct distance between endpoints. For circles/arcs, this
would be the diameter/arc length (to be implemented).

class LengthConstraint : public Constraint {
public:
    /**

## Parameters

- **start_point**: Start point of line {x,y}
- **end_point**: End point of line {x,y}
- **target_length**: Desired length of the line
- **tolerance**: Maximum allowed deviation from target length
