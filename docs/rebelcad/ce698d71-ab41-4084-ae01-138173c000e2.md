# ParallelConstraint

**API Version:** 1.0.0

**Component:** RebelCAD

Represents a parallel constraint between two line segments

The ParallelConstraint ensures that two line segments remain parallel to each other.
A line segment is defined by two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). The constraint uses
vector mathematics to determine parallelism and enforce the constraint.
