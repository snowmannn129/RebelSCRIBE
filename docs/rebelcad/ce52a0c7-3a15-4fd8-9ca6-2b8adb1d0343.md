# TangentConstraint

**API Version:** 1.0.0

**Component:** RebelCAD

Represents a tangency constraint between geometric entities

The TangentConstraint ensures that two geometric entities (lines, circles, or arcs)
maintain a tangent relationship. For lines and circles/arcs, this means the line
touches the curve at exactly one point. For circles/arcs, this means they touch
at exactly one point with a common tangent line at that point.
