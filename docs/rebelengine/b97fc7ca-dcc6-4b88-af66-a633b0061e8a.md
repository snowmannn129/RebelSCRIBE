# FixedJoint

**API Version:** 1.0.0

**Component:** RebelENGINE

Represents a fixed joint constraint between two components in an assembly

A fixed joint completely locks all degrees of freedom (translation and rotation)
between two components, effectively making them behave as a single rigid body.
This is useful for creating permanent or semi-permanent connections in assemblies.
