# SubdivisionSurface

**API Version:** 1.0.0

**Component:** RebelENGINE

Represents a Catmull-Clark subdivision surface

A subdivision surface starts with a coarse control mesh and generates
a smooth surface through iterative refinement. This implementation uses
the Catmull-Clark subdivision scheme which:
- Preserves sharp features
- Handles arbitrary topology
- Produces C2 continuous surfaces except at extraordinary vertices
