**Component:** RebelENGINE

Fixes T-junctions in the mesh by splitting edges

T-junctions occur when a vertex of one face lies on an edge of another face
without being a vertex of that edge. This method detects such cases and
splits the edges to create proper topology.

## Exceptions

- **Error**: if mesh is invalid or operation fails
