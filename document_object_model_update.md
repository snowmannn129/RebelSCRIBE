# Document Object Model and Content Organization System Update

## Summary
The document object model for RebelSCRIBE has been fully implemented (100% complete), and the content organization system has now been implemented (100% complete). This update reflects the current state of these components and updates the progress tracking documents accordingly.

## Changes Made
1. Updated `src/backend/models/progress.md` to reflect that all model components are 100% complete
2. Created a comprehensive content organization system in `src/backend/organization/` with the following components:
   - `metadata_extractor.py`: Extracts metadata from various content types
   - `content_hierarchy.py`: Manages hierarchical organization of content
   - `tag_manager.py`: Manages tags and categories for content
   - `search_index.py`: Provides indexing and searching capabilities
   - `content_organization_system.py`: Integrates all components into a cohesive system
3. Updated `RebelSCRIBE_Weekly_Progress_2025-03-19.md` to:
   - Change Core Framework completion from 40% to 60%
   - Update "Implemented content organization system (100% complete)"
   - Remove blockers related to content organization system
   - Update Next Week's Focus to implement documentation generation system
   - Update overall progress from 10.25% to 15.25%
4. Updated `RebelSCRIBE_Final_Goal_Tracking.md` to:
   - Change Core Framework completion from 40% to 60%
   - Change Content Management completion from 5% to 30%
   - Update overall progress from 10.25% to 15.25%
   - Update Next Steps to implement documentation generation system

## Document Object Model Components
The following components have been fully implemented:

1. **Base Model**
   - BaseModel class with change tracking and serialization

2. **Document**
   - Core Document class with content management
   - Document metadata handling
   - Document versioning
   - Document statistics

3. **Document Version**
   - Version tracking
   - Version metadata
   - Version serialization

4. **Documentation**
   - Documentation-specific attributes
   - Code documentation extraction
   - Documentation generation (Markdown, HTML)

5. **Chapter**
   - Chapter metadata
   - Scene management
   - Chapter statistics

6. **Scene**
   - Scene content management
   - Scene metadata
   - Scene statistics

7. **Character**
   - Character attributes
   - Character relationships
   - Character development tracking
   - Character-document conversion

8. **Location**
   - Location attributes
   - Location relationships
   - Location descriptions
   - Location-document conversion

9. **Note**
   - Note content management
   - Note categorization
   - Note linking
   - Note-document conversion

10. **Tag**
    - Tag attributes
    - Tag relationships

11. **Outline**
    - Outline structure
    - Outline items
    - Outline linking

## Content Organization System Components
The following components have been implemented:

1. **Metadata Extractor**
   - Extracts metadata from Markdown content
   - Extracts metadata from code files
   - Normalizes metadata fields
   - Extracts file metadata

2. **Content Hierarchy**
   - Manages hierarchical organization of content
   - Supports parent-child relationships
   - Provides navigation and traversal methods
   - Supports metadata for nodes

3. **Tag Manager**
   - Manages tags and categories
   - Supports hierarchical tags
   - Provides tag-document relationships
   - Supports tag metadata

4. **Search Index**
   - Indexes document content
   - Provides full-text search
   - Supports metadata filtering
   - Calculates document similarity

5. **Content Organization System**
   - Integrates all components
   - Provides unified API for content organization
   - Handles document processing
   - Manages persistence and backup

## Next Steps
With the document object model and content organization system fully implemented, the next steps are:

1. Implement documentation generation system
2. Enhance markdown parser implementation
3. Implement code documentation extraction
4. Develop documentation browser UI
5. Implement export functionality

## Impact
The completion of the content organization system unblocks several key features:
- Documentation generation
- Content management
- Search functionality
- Tag-based organization
- Hierarchical content navigation

This milestone represents a significant step forward in the development of RebelSCRIBE and brings the project closer to its Alpha Release target.
