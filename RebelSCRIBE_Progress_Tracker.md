# RebelSCRIBE Progress Tracker

## Backup Standard

RebelSCRIBE follows the RebelSUITE backup standard. Backups are created after major milestones:
- Phase completions
- Release types (Alpha, Beta, Full)
- Major development advancements
- Scheduled dates

Backups are stored as ZIP files in `C:\Users\snowm\Desktop\VSCode\Backup` with the naming format:
`RebelSCRIBE_(mmddyyyy)_(current time).zip`

To create a backup, run:
```powershell
.\backup_project.ps1 -ProgramName "RebelSCRIBE" -MilestoneType "<milestone type>"
```

Backup history is documented below in chronological order.
