# RebelSCRIBE Progressive Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for RebelSCRIBE that follows a progressive approach, starting with small, focused tests and gradually building up to full system testing. This approach helps identify issues early in the testing process and ensures that all components work correctly both individually and together.

## Testing Philosophy

1. **Start Small, Build Up**: Begin with unit tests for individual components, then move to integration tests, and finally to comprehensive system tests.
2. **Fail Fast**: Identify and fix issues early in the testing process.
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensure all components and features are thoroughly tested.
4. **Automated Testing**: Use automated testing to ensure consistency and repeatability.
5. **Clear Reporting**: Generate detailed test reports for analysis and troubleshooting.

## Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Unit Tests (Backend)

**Purpose**: Test individual backend components in isolation.

**Focus Areas**:
- Models (Project, Document, Character, Scene, etc.)
- Services (ProjectManager, DocumentManager, SearchService, etc.)
- Utility functions

**Success Criteria**:
- All unit tests pass
- Code coverage meets or exceeds 80% for backend components

### Phase 2: Unit Tests (AI)

**Purpose**: Test individual AI components in isolation.

**Focus Areas**:
- AI service
- Text generator
- Character assistant
- Plot assistant
- Editing assistant

- Training monitor
- Adapter support

**Success Criteria**:
- All AI unit tests pass
- Code coverage meets or exceeds 80% for AI components

### Phase 3: Unit Tests (Utils)

**Purpose**: Test utility functions in isolation.

**Focus Areas**:
- Config manager
- File utilities
- Logging utilities
- String utilities

- File watcher

**Success Criteria**:
- All utility unit tests pass
- Code coverage meets or exceeds 80% for utility components

### Phase 4: Integration Tests

**Purpose**: Test interactions between components.

**Focus Areas**:
- Backend component interactions
- AI component interactions
- Utility component interactions
- Cross-module interactions

**Success Criteria**:
- All integration tests pass
- Components interact correctly
- Data flows correctly between components

### Phase 5: Functional Tests

**Purpose**: Test complete features from a functional perspective.

**Focus Areas**:

**Success Criteria**:
- All functional tests pass
- Features work as expected
- Edge cases are handled correctly

### Phase 6: UI Component Tests

**Purpose**: Test individual UI components.

**Focus Areas**:
- Dialog components (AdapterConfigDialog, TrainingVisualizationDialog, etc.)
- Main window components
- Binder view
- Editor view
- Inspector view

**Success Criteria**:
- All UI component tests pass
- UI components render correctly
- UI components respond correctly to user input

### Phase 7: UI Integration Tests

**Purpose**: Test interactions between UI components.

**Focus Areas**:
- Adapter configuration to training visualization
- Main window to dialog integration
- Cross-component interactions

**Success Criteria**:
- All UI integration tests pass
- UI components interact correctly
- Data flows correctly between UI components

### Phase 8: Adapter Tests

**Purpose**: Test adapter support functionality.

**Focus Areas**:
- Adapter information
- Adapter management
- Adapter configuration
- Adapter training
- Adapter evaluation

**Success Criteria**:
- All adapter tests pass
- Adapters can be configured correctly
- Adapters can be trained correctly
- Adapters can be evaluated correctly

### Phase 9: Advanced AI Tests

**Purpose**: Test advanced AI functionality.

**Focus Areas**:
- Model benchmarking
- Batch benchmarking
- Model fine-tuning
- GPU acceleration
- Model registry

**Success Criteria**:
- All advanced AI tests pass
- Advanced AI features work as expected
- Performance meets or exceeds requirements

### Phase 10: Comprehensive UI Tests

**Purpose**: Test the entire UI system.

**Focus Areas**:
- Component presence
- Component functionality
- Integration between components
- Edge cases
- Error handling

**Success Criteria**:
- All comprehensive UI tests pass
- UI system works as a cohesive whole
- Edge cases and errors are handled correctly

## Test Execution

The progressive testing strategy is implemented in the `progressive_test_strategy.ps1` PowerShell script, which automates the execution of all testing phases. The script provides options to:

- Skip specific phases
- Run tests with increased verbosity
- Stop on the first failure (fail-fast)
- Generate detailed test reports

### Running the Tests

To run all tests in sequence:

```powershell
.\progressive_test_strategy.ps1
```

To run with increased verbosity:

```powershell
.\progressive_test_strategy.ps1 -Verbose
```

To stop on the first failure:

```powershell
.\progressive_test_strategy.ps1 -FailFast
```

To skip specific phases:

```powershell
.\progressive_test_strategy.ps1 -SkipUnitTests -SkipIntegrationTests
```

## Test Results

Test results are saved to the `test_results` directory with timestamped filenames. Each test result file includes:

- Test output
- Test summary
- Status (pass/fail)
- Execution time
- Timestamp

## Troubleshooting

If tests fail, follow these steps:

1. Review the test output for specific error messages
2. Check the test code to understand what's being tested
3. Check the implementation code for issues
4. Fix the issues and re-run the tests
5. If necessary, run individual tests to isolate the problem

## Continuous Integration

This testing strategy can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline by running the PowerShell script as part of the build process. The script's exit code (0 for success, non-zero for failure) can be used to determine if the build should proceed.

## Conclusion

This progressive testing approach ensures that RebelSCRIBE is thoroughly tested at all levels, from individual components to the complete system. By starting with small, focused tests and gradually building up to comprehensive system tests, we can identify and fix issues early in the testing process, resulting in a more stable and reliable application.
