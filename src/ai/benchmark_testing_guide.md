# Benchmark Functionality Testing Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide for testing the benchmark functionality in RebelSCRIBE. It covers all aspects of the benchmark system, including the model benchmarking backend, visualization capabilities, and the benchmark dialog UI.

## Overview of Benchmark Components

The benchmark system consists of three main components:

1. **Model Benchmarking** (`src/ai/model_benchmarking.py`): Provides functionality for benchmarking AI models, comparing their performance, and generating benchmark reports.

2. **Benchmark Visualization** (`src/ai/benchmark_visualization.py`): Provides visualization capabilities for benchmark results, including model comparison plots, benchmark history plots, and radar charts.

3. **Benchmark Dialog** (`src/ui/benchmark_dialog.py`): Provides a user interface for running benchmarks, viewing results, comparing models, and generating reports.
