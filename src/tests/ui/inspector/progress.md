- Test Execution: 100% complete (6/6 test files passing)

**Inspector View Tests Progress: 100% complete**

## Refactoring Notes
The original test_inspector_view.py file was too large and has been refactored into smaller, more focused test modules. The main benefits of this refactoring are:

1. Improved maintainability - Each test file now focuses on a single component
2. Better organization - Tests are grouped by the component they test
3. Easier debugging - Issues can be isolated to specific components
4. Faster test runs - Tests can be run individually for specific components

The original test_inspector_view.py file now serves as an entry point that imports all the modularized tests.
